# Keep on top of the latest steam flash sale

1. Check (Steam) site for flash sales
2. Notify people if there are new things to spend money on
3. ???
4. Profit! (not for us)

Simple script that grabs current flash sale items from the Steam store (probably only works during the Steam Summer Sale 2014, as it depends on HTML specific XPath/CSS selectors to scrape data.

Keep this in mind for next year, it could definitly be improved.

- cache results to notify only when things change
- hook it up to a twitter feed or mailing list or push notifications
- somehow set it up to automatically buy games that are less than a certain price ($2, hell yeah)
- scrape platform data so we know if it's Mac/Win/Linux
